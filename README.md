# PCPNet: An Efficient and Semantic-Enhanced Transformer Network for Point Cloud Prediction

![](figs/motivation.png)
*PCPNet predicts future F range images based on the given past P sequential range images. The semantic information in the sequential range images is extracted for training, making the outputs of PCPNet closer to the ground truth in semantics.*
